# calciobot by ubercl0ud
Simple reddit bot to update the sidebar with Serie A live table, and top scorers.  Nothing really fancy. 

## How to
* Copy config.ini.default to config.ini
* Set the following:
```
username: <your bot's username>
password: <your bot's password>
subreddit: <your subreddit without the /r/>
userAgent: Soccer_Bot_S/v1.1.0 by <your bot's username>
```

## Example
```
username: calciobot
password: somepassword
subreddit: calciobot
userAgent: Soccer_Bot_S/v1.1.0 by calciobot
```

## Notes
* Note that the userAgent **MUST** be changed or it will go against reddit's TOS.
